# Poptart-Bot

Welcome to the repository for my personal Discord bot!

## Purpose
This bot is intended to be a multi-functional Discord bot with a variety of commands and user interactions.

One intended goal of this bot is to include audio functionality, similar to the old Rhythm bot.

## Development
This bot is being developed with Discord.JS in Visual Studio Code. It is hosted on Heroku to ensure a 24/7 uptime.
